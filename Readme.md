# Reusable Components

This is just a set of reusable components for later usage. I wanted a directory/repo that I could pull from when I wanted, instead of searching around all the time.

# Sidebar - One

This sidebar is an ondemand (via button click) sidebar. It can be switched from right to left. The width of the sidebar can also be changed to any width you want. 

# Sidebar - Two 

This second sidebar is similar in someways to #1. Instead, this is designed to show a hamburger menu upon a certain device width (eg: mobile it will show a hamburger menu, desktop, it will show a full navbar).

# RotatingCard

Here, I'm using the perspective property in css to rotate a card 180deg. This means that it has a front and back to it, where I can input 2 different sets of information,
if I wanted.

# Modal

It's a modal. It does modal things. It creates a popup when you click a button.
